How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    using fc command to compare files for windows

	cd into folder with files to compare

	use syntax fc 'old file' 'new file'

	only lines that have changed are shown 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Commit changes that are grouped around one logical change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log command shows the history of commits in the repo

	important to note that most recent commits appear at the top, scrolling down alows you to see older commits

	git diff lets you compare two commits, syntax is 'git diff oldcommit newcommit'

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    git checkout followed by commit id allows you to revert back to a previous version of the repo

	this is useful when evaluating code for a bug 

	process is: (a) checkout an older commit where commit may be bug free

	(b) check result - if bug free, check set of commits between latest commit (with bug) and previous commit (free of bug) - by checking out one commit at the time and runnign the code, we should be able to identify which commit introduces the bug

	important to note that git log after a checkout does not show the latest commits - one solution to checkout recent commits is to copy the commit id of the most recent commit - but there are other solutions
